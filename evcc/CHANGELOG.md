## Breacking Changes

### Starting from [0.209.7] - 2025-11-03

IMPORTANT: Starting with this release, the config evcc.yaml is OPTIONAL. 
You could still use your evcc.yaml, but have one time reconfigure your Add-on configuration (!NOT your evcc config!) and add `config_file: /config/evcc.yaml` (standard).

Please read the _Configuration-File_ section [here](https://docs.evcc.io/en/docs/installation/home-assistant#configuration-file) to understand the standard configuration.

### Starting from [0.200.1] - 2025-02-16

IMPORTANT: Starting with this release, we are following the Home Assistant approach for storing user configuration data held by addons.

Please read the _Important_ section [here](https://docs.evcc.io/en/docs/installation/home-assistant) to understand the changes we automatically apply for you.
