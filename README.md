# Home Assistant Addon

:::note
This guide is aimed for users running Home Assistant. Of course it is possible to run EVCC outside Home Assistant too, but as is has a very low footprint running EVCC as an
Addon is the simplest ways.
:::

## Installation Guide

1. Click -> Add-on Store under Settings - Addons.
2. Click -> three dots -> Repositories.
3. Copy https://github.com/evcc-io/hassio-addon Click -> Add
4. Reload the WebSite (CTRL+R or CTRL+F5 or CTRL+Fn+F5)
5. Find the "evcc" add-on and click it.
6. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

### Configuration

Go to Information menu in the "evcc" Addon and activate "show in side bar" (evcc UI http://your-ha-instance-ip-address:7070)

Go to Configuration menu and select your working directory (example):
<!---

```sh
- config_file: /config/evcc.yaml
- sqlite_file: /data/evcc.db
```
Alternative file location:
```sh
- config_file: /config/evcc/evcc.yaml
- sqlite_file: /config/evcc/evcc.db
```

Leave the Network section unchanged.

Create an evcc configuration file _evcc.yaml_in your Home Assistant root configuration folder (/homeassistant).

Copy the content of this [Template](conf_templates/ha_evcc_template.yaml) to your _homeassistant/evcc.yaml_ file you just created.
The template creates a default configuration with static demo entities.

:::note
If you want to see evcc how is running in dynamic demo instead, copy the content of https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/blob/master/cmd/demo.yaml into your _evcc.yaml_file.
:::

- Now you are ready to go and to start the addon.
- Check the installation by opening the WebUI. You should see the evcc web interface in demo mode.
- If this runs well you can start to edit the _evcc.yaml_ file and creating your own setup (only with the static template possible).

:::tip
If you struggle with the manual configuration you might consider to install a standalone evcc Windows or Linux system and using the Configuration wizard.

The Configuration wizard is not available under the Home Assistant environment!!!

You will find it easier to use `evcc configure` there, and then copy the generated _evcc.yaml_ to the desired system.

**Advanced users** (those with evcc experience & some technical know-how) might want to use the advanced configurator:
:::

- Test each new added device to make sure your new configuration works.
- Once all devices are configured, you can continue on to the setup via the UI.
